    declares that value on the band, and is deliberately separate: a value can be

        resolution: Pixel resolution in CRS units (default: 10.0 meters)
        num_workers: Number of parallel workers (default: CPU count, capped at 8)
        chip_dirs: Optional dict mapping item_id (grid_id or grid_id_year) to output directory.
                   If None, one is built under ``output_dir/chips`` from the grid cells
                   that pass the coverage filter, matching the pipeline's layout.
        year: Optional year for year-based naming convention (e.g., 2024).
              When provided, item IDs and filenames include the year.
        background_class_value: Value to use for background pixels (default: 0). Use 3 for presence-only labels.
        skip_existing: When True, cells whose output file already exists with a non-zero
                       size are not recreated (counted in the result's masks_existing).
        on_progress: Optional callback (current, total) for progress updates
        on_start: Optional callback (total_grids, filtered_grids, total_tasks) called before
                  processing. total_tasks is the number of rasterizations actually queued
                  (filtered_grids x rasterization groups, less anything skip_existing
                  filtered out), which is what on_progress counts up to.
