"""Render definitions for the rasters on chip items and the collection.

A chip item's label COGs are single-band and low-valued, so a viewer that draws
them raw shows a near-black square. The
`render extension <https://github.com/stac-extensions/render>`_ tells a client how
to draw each one instead.

Colour is *not* set here for the categorical masks: their colours live in
``classification:classes[].color_hint`` (see :mod:`ftw_dataset_tools.api.assets`),
which is the primary rendering mechanism for them. The render entries for those
masks carry only the asset, a title and ``nodata`` so background pixels are drawn
transparent. Only the genuinely continuous rasters -- the normalized DECODE
distance map and the id-valued instance mask -- get a colour ramp
(``colormap_name``).

A chip that has season imagery also gets a true-colour render per season, and
:func:`build_render_order` names the stack a viewer should open the item on:
the fields drawn over that season's imagery. See that function for the
convention.
