"""Image selection orchestration for STAC catalogs.

This module provides workflow functions for selecting imagery across all chips
in a catalog. It is used by the `create-dataset` command and the `ftwd run`
pipeline. The standalone `select-images` command still runs its own loop (it
supports per-chip year extraction) but shares the per-chip body
(`run_chip_selection`, which writes via `create_child_items_from_selection`), the
skip predicate (`has_existing_scenes`) and the thread pool, so selection output
is identical across all three paths.

Chips are processed concurrently: a chip is several STAC searches' worth of
network wait, and no two chips touch the same files. Only the calling thread
reads the results, so the counters and the progress display never race.
