    """Convert a catalog's JPEG chip previews to WebP.

    Chip previews are written as WebP, which is 25-35% smaller than JPEG at
    equivalent quality. A catalog built before that switch still has .jpg previews
    on disk and .jpg hrefs in its items; this converts it in place.

    Each preview is re-rendered from the imagery it was made from -- the chip's
    local clipped GeoTIFF when there is one, otherwise its remote scene -- so the
    result is compressed once rather than re-encoded from an already-lossy JPEG.
    The chip item and its season children are repointed at the WebP, and only then
    is the superseded .jpg removed.

    Chips that already have only WebP previews are skipped, so the command is safe
    to re-run and resumes cleanly after an interruption.
