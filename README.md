# FTW Dataset Tools

CLI tools for creating the [Fields of the World](https://fieldsofthe.world/) benchmark dataset.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install ftw-dataset-tools
```

Or for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cholmes/ftw-dataset-tools
cd ftw-dataset-tools
uv sync --dev
```

`uv sync` creates a project virtual environment in `.venv`. Activate it so the
`ftwd` command and dependencies are on your `PATH`:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows (PowerShell/cmd)

ftwd --help                      # verify it works
```

Alternatively, run commands without activating by prefixing them with `uv run`,
e.g. `uv run ftwd --help`.

## Usage

```bash
# Show available commands
ftwd --help
```

### run (config-driven workflow)

Run the whole pipeline from a single YAML config file instead of a long chain of
CLI flags. This keeps every setting in one place and records exactly what went
into a dataset: a fully-resolved copy of the config (all defaults filled in, plus
the `ftwd` version and a timestamp) is written to the output directory as
`ftwd-config.resolved.yaml` and embedded in the STAC root catalog under the
`ftw:config` field.

```bash
# Run the full pipeline from a config
ftwd run config.yaml

# Preview the resolved config and the stages that would run (no execution)
ftwd run config.yaml --dry-run

# List the pipeline stages in order
ftwd run config.yaml --list-stages

# Run or re-run a single stage (forced, even if disabled in the config)
ftwd run config.yaml --only masks

# Run from a stage to the end, or from the start through a stage
ftwd run config.yaml --from select_images
ftwd run config.yaml --through stac
```

Stages run in this order: `reproject`, `chips`, `splits`, `boundaries`, `masks`,
`stac`, `select_images`, `download_images`, `docs`. Intermediate outputs follow a fixed
naming convention in the output directory, so individual stages can be re-run on
their own as long as their inputs already exist.

`select_images` searches for cloud-free Sentinel-2 scenes in the
[Sentinel-2 STAC-GeoParquet mirror](https://source.coop/portolan-mirrors/sentinel-2-catalog)
by default: partitioned parquet queried in place with DuckDB, no API and no rate
limit, so selection runs at 16 workers instead of the 4 the Earth Search API
tolerates. It reads the mirror's `sentinel-2-c1-l2a` collection (ESA's
Collection 1 reprocessing, one consistent baseline across the archive), the
same collection the Earth Search backend queries. Set
`stages.select_images.search_backend: earth-search` (or
`--search-backend earth-search` on `ftwd select-images`) to query the Earth
Search STAC API instead.

Set `stages.stac.checksums: true` to add a `file:checksum` to the assets the `stac` stage
itself writes: the label masks on every chip item, and the parquet collection assets
(`fields`, `boundary_lines`, `chips`, `items`). Imagery and thumbnail assets do not get a
checksum, because `select_images` and `download_images` run after `stac` and add those
assets later. Checksums are off by default because hashing tens of thousands of COGs is
slow.

Chip items are written to render straight out of the box: each season's true-colour
source scene is mirrored onto the item as a `visual` asset, mask classes carry
`color_hint` colours, and `renders` supplies the nodata and the continuous colour ramps
(see [docs/stac-extension.md](docs/stac-extension.md#rendering)).

**docs stage.** The final stage turns what was measured about the collection into
ready-to-browse outputs. With [tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe) on
`PATH` it tiles the chips and fields into `chips.pmtiles` / `fields.pmtiles`, then
writes up to five MapLibre GL styles under `styles/` — split, field coverage,
dominant crop, crops, and outline — each written only when the data and matching
tiles it needs are actually present, and each checked against the data so a style
never shows a legend entry that does not occur in the collection. Without
tippecanoe, tiling and styles are skipped with a warning and the rest of the stage
still runs. It also writes `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the collection root from
the same measured numbers; every example query in `AGENTS.md` is executed against
the collection before its first rows are inlined. Both documents and the tiles/styles
are registered on `collection.json` (`describedby` and `agents` links; `chips_tiles`,
`fields_tiles` and `style-<id>` assets). Control this with `stages.docs.pmtiles`
(`auto`, the default, builds tiles when tippecanoe is installed and warns otherwise;
`true` fails the run if tippecanoe is missing; `false` skips tiles and their styles
entirely) and `stages.docs.readme` / `stages.docs.agents` (each `true` by default).
The output directory gains:

```
├── README.md              # what the collection contains, from measured numbers
├── AGENTS.md              # schema, quality notes, and executed example queries
├── chips.pmtiles          # chip vector tiles (only if tippecanoe ran)
├── fields.pmtiles         # field vector tiles (only if tippecanoe ran)
└── styles/
    ├── split.json           # e.g. chips by train/val/test split
    ├── field-coverage.json
    ├── dominant-crop.json
    ├── crops.json
    └── outline.json
```

Add a `metadata:` block (title, description, license, providers, keywords, version) to
make the output publishable; see `configs/examples/config.yaml`. The stac stage warns
when `license` is missing.

**Remote input.** `fields_file` may be an `https://` URL instead of a local
path, e.g. a harmonized fiboa collection file. Plain `http://` is rejected: the recorded
checksum should attest to bytes that could not have been swapped in transit. It is downloaded once into
`stages.fetch.cache_dir` (default `~/.cache/ftwd/sources`) as a file named by a hash of
the URL, and the cached copy is reused on later runs; set `stages.fetch.refresh: true`
to force a re-download. `ftwd run config.yaml --dry-run` prints the source and never
downloads it. Set `source_via` to the URL of the upstream collection to record it as a
`via` link on the output STAC collection. The resolved provenance
(`ftwd-config.resolved.yaml` and `ftw:config`) records a `source` block (`href`, `via`,
`sha256`, `size`, `fetched_at`) for both remote and local inputs — for a local input
`href` is just the filename, so the build machine's directory layout is not published — plus
`ftwd_git_commit` when `ftwd` itself was installed from a git checkout.

**Crop composition.** When the fields file carries the fiboa HCAT extension
(an `hcat:code` column, plus optionally `hcat:name_en`), the chips stage computes each
chip's area-weighted crop composition from the same class-filtered field polygons the
masks are burned from: the dominant HCAT code, its English name and share, and the top
five codes by area, written to the chips GeoParquet as `hcat_dominant_code`,
`hcat_dominant_name_en`, `hcat_dominant_pct` and `hcat_top`. These carry through to the
STAC chip items as `ftw:hcat_dominant_code`, `ftw:hcat_dominant_name_en`,
`ftw:hcat_dominant_pct` and `ftw:hcat_top` (see [docs/stac-extension.md](docs/stac-extension.md)).
The name falls back to the `hcat:name` column when `hcat:name_en` is absent. The
percentages are shares of the chip's total field-covered area, so they sum below 100 when
some of the fields in the chip carry no HCAT code. Note that this is a different
denominator from `field_coverage_pct`, which is a share of the chip's own area.
Datasets whose fields lack `hcat:code` skip this step with a note in the run output; set
`stages.chips.crop_stats: false` to disable it even when the column is present.

**Resuming past the chips stage.** The chips GeoParquet is written by the chips stage and
reused as-is by every later stage, so a run started with `--from` or `--stage` after
`chips` publishes whatever that file already holds. Turning `stages.chips.crop_stats` off
is handled: the stac stage drops any stale composition columns before publishing. Other
chips settings are not — change `min_coverage`, `drop_border_chips`, `border_gap_chips`,
`grid_file` or the class filter and you must re-run the `chips` stage for the change to
reach the output.

**Border chips.** `drop_border_chips` removes chips on the edge of a labelled cluster,
where part of the chip falls outside the labelled area and its unlabelled side would be
rasterised as background. Label collections are often sampled as separate blocks, so this
is applied per cluster rather than once over the whole dataset. `border_gap_chips`
(default 2) sets how wide an unlabelled gap must be, in chips, before it counts as a
cluster edge; gaps narrower than that, and holes fully enclosed by labelled chips such as
lakes or towns, are treated as interior. Keep it at 2 or more when `min_chip_area` is on:
the chips it drops along a UTM zone seam leave a gap of up to two chips.

#### Class filter (optional)

If your fields file has a crop-type / class column, you can restrict which
classes count as *field* vs *background*. Store the lists in their own YAML and
reference it under `stages.masks.class_filter` (path is relative to the config
file):

```yaml
# config.yaml
stages:
  masks:
    class_filter: class_filter.yaml

# class_filter.yaml
column: crop_type
include: [wheat, barley, maize]      # count as field
exclude: [urban, water, forest]     # count as background
```

The filter is applied up front, so coverage stats, boundary lines, and masks all
reflect only the included classes (the full, unfiltered fields file is still kept
and published as the STAC source asset). Every distinct non-null value in the
column must appear in `include` or `exclude` — any unlisted value aborts the run
so no class is silently mishandled. NULL class values are treated as background.
Values are compared as strings (numeric crop codes work). The same filter is
available on `create-dataset` via `--class-filter <path>`.
See [`configs/examples/class_filter.yaml`](configs/examples/class_filter.yaml).

`column` may also be a list of candidate names, tried in order — handy when the
same filter is reused across datasets that name the column differently:

```yaml
column: [crop_code, "crop:code"]   # use whichever one the fields file has
```

See [`configs/examples/config.yaml`](configs/examples/config.yaml) for a fully documented config.
A minimal config:

```yaml
fields_file: austria_fields.parquet
output_dir: ./austria-dataset
name: austria
year: 2023

stages:
  splits:
    split_type: random-uniform
  select_images:
    enabled: true
  download_images:
    enabled: false
```

### inspect-fields

Quickly summarize a fields (Geo)Parquet file before building a dataset: columns,
per-column value counts and stats, and a geometry/CRS summary. Columns that look
like good class-filter candidates are highlighted, so this pairs well with the
class filter above.

```bash
# Summarize a fields file
ftwd inspect-fields austria_fields.parquet

# Show ALL values for a class column (handy when writing a class filter)
ftwd inspect-fields austria_fields.parquet -c crop:name --top 0

# Skip the geometry scan (faster), or emit machine-readable JSON
ftwd inspect-fields austria_fields.parquet --no-geometry
ftwd inspect-fields austria_fields.parquet --json
```

It reports row/column counts and file size; a geometry summary (geometry types,
total bounds, and CRS name/kind/EPSG); and, per column, the dtype, distinct and
null counts, plus value counts (categorical), min/max/mean/median/quantiles
(numeric), or the min→max range (temporal). High-cardinality unique columns are
detected as identifiers and their values are not dumped.

Options: `--top N` (max values per categorical column; `0` = all, safety-capped),
`-c/--column` (show all values for a column, repeatable), `--no-geometry`, `--json`.

### create-dataset

Create a complete training dataset from a single fields file. This is the main command that orchestrates the entire pipeline.

```bash
# Basic usage with required split-type
ftwd create-dataset austria_fields.parquet --split-type random-uniform

# Specify output directory and dataset name
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --field-dataset austria --split-type block3x3 -o ./austria_dataset

# Custom split percentages
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --split-type random-uniform --split-percents 70 20 10

# Generate only specific mask types
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --split-type block3x3 --mask-types semantic_2_class,semantic_3_class

# For presence-only labels (background class = 3 instead of 0)
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --split-type block3x3 --presence-only

# If fields lack determination_datetime column, specify year
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --split-type block3x3 --year 2023

# Custom options
ftwd create-dataset fields.parquet --split-type block3x3 --min-coverage 1.0 --resolution 5.0 --workers 8
```

**Options:**
- `--split-type` - **Required.** Split strategy: `random-uniform` (random assignment of chips) or `block3x3` (3x3 blocks of chips assigned together for spatial coherence)
- `--split-percents` - Train/val/test split percentages as three integers that sum to 100 (default: 80 10 10)
- `--mask-types` - Comma-separated list of mask types to generate: `instance`, `semantic_2_class`, `semantic_3_class` (default: all three)
- `--presence-only` - Flag indicating labels are presence-only; background class value will be 3 instead of 0
- `-o, --output-dir` - Output directory (defaults to `{input_stem}-dataset/`)
- `--field-dataset` - Dataset name for output filenames (defaults to input filename stem)
- `--year` - Year for temporal extent (only required if fields lack `determination_datetime` column)
- `--min-coverage` - Minimum coverage percentage to include grids (default: 0.01)
- `--resolution` - Pixel resolution in meters for masks (default: 10.0)
- `--workers` - Number of parallel workers (default: half of CPUs)
- `--skip-reproject` - Fail if input is not EPSG:4326 instead of auto-reprojecting
- `--checksums` - Add `file:checksum` (multihash sha256) to the assets written by the stac
  stage (source parquet, chips parquet, items parquet, masks); slow on large datasets.
  Imagery and thumbnails are written after the stac stage and do not get checksums.

**Output structure:**

The output directory is a self-contained STAC collection with chip items grouped into sub-catalogs by MGRS 100 km square:

```
{name}/
├── collection.json                   # STAC collection root
├── {name}_fields.parquet             # Field boundaries in EPSG:4326
├── {name}_fields_filtered.parquet    # Filtered fields (if class filter applied)
├── {name}_chips.parquet              # Chip definitions with field coverage stats
├── {name}_boundary_lines.parquet     # Boundary lines from vector data
├── items.parquet                     # Collection mirror (STAC items as Parquet; only if any chip has masks)
└── chips/
    ├── {mgrs100k}/
    │   ├── catalog.json              # Sub-catalog for MGRS 100 km square
    │   └── {item_id}/                # Item JSON and its assets, flat, side by side
    │       ├── {item_id}.json                   # Chip item
    │       ├── {item_id}_{mask_type}.tif        # Masks (if masks generated)
    │       ├── {item_id}_{season}_s2.json       # Scene items (if imagery selected)
    │       ├── {item_id}_{season}_image_s2.tif   # Clipped imagery (if downloaded)
    │       ├── {item_id}_{season}_image_s2.webp  # Previews (if downloaded)
    │       └── {item_id}_overlay.webp            # Preview with the mask drawn over it
    └── other/                        # For non-FTW grid ids
        ├── catalog.json
        └── {item_id}/...
```

The MGRS square (e.g., `33UXP`) is extracted from FTW grid ids like `ftw-33UXP0410`; custom grid ids are placed under `other`.

### create-chips

Create chip definitions with field coverage statistics. Calculates what percentage of each grid cell is covered by field boundary polygons.

```bash
# Fetch grid from FTW grid on Source Coop
ftwd create-chips fields.parquet

# Use local grid file
ftwd create-chips fields.parquet --grid-file grid.parquet

# Filter by minimum coverage
ftwd create-chips fields.parquet --min-coverage 0.01

# Reproject if CRS don't match
ftwd create-chips fields.parquet --reproject
```

**Options:**
- `--grid-file` - Local grid file (if not specified, fetches from FTW grid on Source Coop)
- `-o, --output` - Output file path (defaults to `chips_<fields_basename>.parquet`)
- `--coverage-col` - Name for coverage column (default: `field_coverage_pct`)
- `--min-coverage` - Exclude grid cells below this coverage percentage
- `--min-chip-area` - Exclude chips smaller than this percentage of a full `--km-size` cell (default: 99.5, so chips truncated at UTM zone boundaries are removed - about 1.4% of cells - while every full cell is kept; pass 0 to keep them)
- `--km-size` - Nominal chip edge length in km, the reference for `--min-chip-area` (default: 2.0)
- `--reproject` - Reproject both inputs to EPSG:4326 if CRS don't match
- `--grid-geom-col`, `--fields-geom-col` - Geometry column names (auto-detected)
- `--grid-bbox-col`, `--fields-bbox-col` - Bbox column names (auto-detected)

### create-masks

Create raster masks from vector boundaries for each grid cell. Outputs Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs).

Masks are written into the same catalog layout `create-dataset` produces, alongside a STAC
collection describing them, so standalone output can feed `select-images` and `download-images`:

```
{output-dir}/
├── collection.json
└── chips/
    └── {mgrs100k}/                 # 'other' for non-FTW grid ids
        ├── catalog.json
        └── {item_id}/
            ├── {item_id}.json
            └── {item_id}_{mask_type}.tif
```

`{item_id}` is `{grid_id}_{year}`. The year comes from `--year`, or, when that is omitted, from
the boundaries file's `determination_datetime` column, exactly as `create-dataset` derives it.

```bash
# Create semantic 2-class masks
ftwd create-masks chips.parquet fields.parquet boundary_lines.parquet --field-dataset austria --year 2024

# Create instance masks
ftwd create-masks chips.parquet fields.parquet lines.parquet --field-dataset france --mask-type instance --year 2024

# Custom settings
ftwd create-masks chips.parquet fields.parquet lines.parquet --field-dataset spain --min-coverage 1.0 --resolution 5.0 --year 2024
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output-dir` - Dataset root; masks go under `{output-dir}/chips/` (default: `./masks`)
- `--field-dataset` - Dataset name, used as the STAC collection id (required)
- `--year` - Year folded into item ids and filenames. Required unless the boundaries file has a `determination_datetime` column, which the year is otherwise derived from (the collection also needs it for its temporal extent)
- `--mask-type` - Type of mask: `instance`, `semantic_2_class`, `semantic_3_class`, `decode_boundary`, or `decode_distance` (default: `semantic_3_class`)
- `--grid-id-col` - Column name for grid cell ID (default: `id`)
- `--coverage-col` - Column name for coverage percentage (default: `field_coverage_pct`)
- `--min-coverage` - Minimum coverage to process (default: 0.01)
- `--resolution` - Pixel resolution in CRS units (default: 10.0)
- `--workers` - Number of parallel workers (default: CPU count, capped at 8)
- `--skip-existing` - Reuse masks already on disk instead of recreating them

### create-boundaries

Convert polygon geometries to boundary lines using ST_Boundary.

```bash
# Single file
ftwd create-boundaries fields.parquet

# Process entire directory
ftwd create-boundaries ./data/

# Custom output
ftwd create-boundaries fields.parquet -o ./output/ --prefix lines_
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output-dir` - Output directory (defaults to same directory as input)
- `--prefix` - Prefix for output filenames (default: `boundary_lines_`)

### create-ftw-grid

Create a hierarchical FTW grid from 1km MGRS cells.

```bash
# Single file
ftwd create-ftw-grid mgrs_1km.parquet

# Custom grid size
ftwd create-ftw-grid mgrs_1km.parquet --km-size 4

# Process partitioned folder
ftwd create-ftw-grid ./mgrs_partitioned/ -o ./ftw_output/
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output` - Output path (required for folder input)
- `--km-size` - Grid cell size in km (default: 2). Must divide 100 evenly (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100)

**Output columns:**
- `gzd` - Grid Zone Designator
- `mgrs_10km` - 10km MGRS code from source
- `id` - Unique FTW grid cell ID (e.g., `ftw-33UXPA0410`)
- `geometry` - Unioned polygon of child cells

### get-grid

Fetch FTW grid cells from cloud source that cover the input file's extent.

```bash
# Basic usage
ftwd get-grid fields.parquet

# Precise geometry matching (slower)
ftwd get-grid fields.parquet --precise

# Custom output
ftwd get-grid fields.parquet -o custom_grid.parquet
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output` - Output file path (defaults to `<input>_grid.parquet`)
- `--precise` - Use geometry union for precise matching (excludes grids in bbox gaps)
- `--grid-source` - URL/path to the grid source

### Reprojection

For reprojecting GeoParquet files to a different CRS, use [geoparquet-io](https://geoparquet.io/):

```bash
gpio reproject input.parquet -o output.parquet --target-crs EPSG:4326
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linting
uv run ruff check .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .
```

### Changing dependencies

After editing `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and stage `uv.lock` in the **same**
commit:

```bash
uv lock
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
```

The pre-commit `pytest` hook and CI both run with `--locked`, so a `pyproject.toml`
change without a matching `uv.lock` fails with `error: The lockfile at uv.lock needs
to be updated`. Staging only `pyproject.toml` fails the same way even after running
`uv lock`, because pre-commit stashes the unstaged lockfile before running the hook.
